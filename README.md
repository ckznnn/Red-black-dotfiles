# hypr is all the files for the hyprland config, includes the customisation as well as my keybinds i use. (either replace the entire hypr folder in .condig with this or add my configs inside.)
# Icons go straight into the icons files and changed all icons or replace entire folder.
# kitty is the terminal config you need kitty config which already comes automatic with hyprland, replace the file in the .config folder
# the rest of the files are for my gtk theme, place all folders into another folder then replace your overall gtk theme using dconf-editor.
